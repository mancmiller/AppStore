# Project 
My take on recreating a rough draft of the AppStore following the LBTA course. The AppStore data was taken from https://rss.applemarketingtools.com/ and fetched inside the project with JSON responses. Spent quality time along the way learning a lot about CollectionViews and animations.

# Installation 
• git clone https://github.com/mancmiller/AppStore    
• open terminal cd to the directory and run pod install  
• open AppStore/AppStore.xcworkspace   
• open Xcode and run the project 

# Technology Stack
• UIKit  
• Cocoapods (SDWebImage)  
• iOS RSS Feed Generator
